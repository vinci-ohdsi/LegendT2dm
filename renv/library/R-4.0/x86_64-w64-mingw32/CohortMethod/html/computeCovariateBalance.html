<h2>Compute covariate balance before and after matching and trimming</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For every covariate, prevalence in treatment and comparator groups before and after
matching/trimming are computed. When variable ratio matching was used the balance score will be
corrected according the method described in Austin et al (2008).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
computeCovariateBalance(
  population,
  cohortMethodData,
  subgroupCovariateId = NULL,
  maxCohortSize = 250000
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>population</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing the people that are remaining after matching
and/or trimming.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cohortMethodData</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of type <a href="CohortMethodData-class.html">CohortMethodData</a> as generated using
<code><a href="getDbCohortMethodData.html">getDbCohortMethodData()</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subgroupCovariateId</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional: a covariate ID of a binary covariate that indicates a subgroup of
interest. Both the before and after populations will be restricted to this
subgroup before computing covariate balance.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>maxCohortSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the target or comparator cohort are larger than this number, they
will be downsampled before computing covariate balance to save time.
Setting this number to 0 means no downsampling will be applied.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The population data frame should have the following three columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> rowId (numeric): A unique identifier for each row (e.g. the person ID).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> treatment (integer): Column indicating whether the person is in the target (1) or comparator (0) group.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> propensityScore (numeric): Propensity score.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a tibble describing the covariate balance before and after PS adjustment,
with one row per covariate, with the same data as the <code>covariateRef</code> table in the <code>CohortMethodData</code> object,
and the following additional columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> beforeMatchingMeanTarget: The (weighted) mean value in the target before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingMeanComparator: The (weighted) mean value in the comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingSumTarget: The (weighted) sum value in the target before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingSumComparator: The (weighted) sum value in the comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingSdTarget: The standard deviation of the value in the target before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingSdComparator: The standard deviation of the value in the comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingMean: The mean of the value across target and comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingSd: The standard deviation of the value across target and comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingMeanTarget: The (weighted) mean value in the target after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingMeanComparator: The (weighted) mean value in the comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingSumTarget: The (weighted) sum value in the target after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingSumComparator: The (weighted) sum value in the comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingSdTarget: The standard deviation of the value in the target after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingSdComparator: The standard deviation of the value in the comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingMean: The mean of the value across target and comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingSd: The standard deviation of the value across target and comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> beforeMatchingStdDiff: The standardized difference of means when comparing the target to
the comparator before PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> afterMatchingStdDiff: The standardized difference of means when comparing the target to
the comparator after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> targetStdDiff: The standardized difference of means when comparing the target
before PS adjustment to the target after PS adjustment.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> comparatorStdDiff: The standardized difference of means when comparing the comparator
before PS adjustment to the comparator after PS adjustment.
-targetComparatorStdDiff:  The standardized difference of means when comparing the entire
population before PS adjustment to the entire population after
PS adjustment.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The 'beforeMatchingStdDiff' and 'afterMatchingStdDiff' columns inform on the balance:
are the target and comparator sufficiently similar in terms of baseline covariates to
allow for valid causal estimation?
</p>
<p>The 'targetStdDiff', 'comparatorStdDiff', and 'targetComparatorStdDiff' columns inform on
the generalizability: are the cohorts after PS adjustment sufficiently similar to the cohorts
before adjustment to allow generalizing the findings to the original cohorts?
