The population is primarily representative of commercial claims patients (0-65 years old) with some Medicare (65+ years old) however ages are capped at 90 years.  It includes data captured from administrative claims processed from inpatient and outpatient medical services and prescriptions as dispensed, as well as results for outpatient lab tests processed by large national lab vendors who participate in data exchange with Optum.  This dataset also provides date of death (month and year only) for members with both medical and pharmacy coverage from the Social Security Death Master File (however after 2011 reporting frequency changed due to changes in reporting requirements) and location information for patients is at the US state level."
