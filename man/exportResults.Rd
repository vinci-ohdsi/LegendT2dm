\arguments{
\item{indicationId}{A string denoting the indicationId for which the results should be
exported.}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward slashes

\item{databaseDescription}{A short description (several sentences) of the database.}

\item{exportSettings}{A list of options for exporting csv files; see `createExportSettings()`.}

\item{minCellCount}{The minimum cell count for fields contains person counts or fractions.}

available this can speed up the analyses.}
